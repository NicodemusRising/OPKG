On the Software page, click update, then install the packages below. These can alternatively be pasted into SSH with opkg install. Note: below uses ext4 filesystem, alternatively you can use any you prefer: kmod-fs-ext4, kmod-fs-btrfs, kmod-fs-exfat, ntfs-3g, etc.

block-mount e2fsprogs kmod-usb-storage-uas kmod-usb3 luci-app-hd-idle kmod-fs-ext4

2. Plug in your USB drive, it will be detected automatically as /dev/sdXX depending on the drive and partition numbers.

3. Go to the System → Mount Points page and click on the drive to mount, click save & apply.

4. Go to the Services → HDD Idle page and enable to idle the drive to save power and lifespan, click save & apply.

You're done! The drive is ready to read/write data.

Command Line
1. Use a computer to format your USB drive using the default options. This prepares the drive for the process below, which will erase those settings. Warning: This initial formatting will erase the entire USB drive.

2. SSH into your device and enter the following commands. More...

3. Install the required packages. Note: below uses ext4 filesystem, alternatively you can use any you prefer (kmod-fs-ext4, kmod-fs-btrfs, kmod-fs-exfat, ntfs-3g, etc). More...

opkg update && opkg install block-mount e2fsprogs kmod-usb-storage-uas kmod-usb3 kmod-fs-ext4
4. Enter ls -al /dev/sd* to show the name of all attached USB devices. The list may be empty if there are no USB devices. More...

5. Insert the USB drive into your router. Enter ls -al /dev/sd* again, and this time you should see a new /dev/sdXX device. sdXX is the device name of your new USB device. More...

    root@OpenWrt:~# ls -al /dev/sd*
    brw-------    1 root     root        8,   0 Feb  4 15:13 /dev/sda
    brw-------    1 root     root        8,   1 Feb  4 14:06 /dev/sda1
6. Make an ext4 filesystem on the USB device using the device name you just discovered. Note: Be certain you enter the proper device name - this step will completely erase the device. More...

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
7. Create the fstab config file based on all the block devices found. More...

block detect | uci import fstab
8. Update the fstab config file to mount all drives at startup. More...

uci set fstab.@mount[0].enabled='1' && uci set fstab.@global[0].anon_mount='1' && uci commit fstab
9. Mount the device. More...

/etc/init.d/fstab boot
You're done! The drive is ready to read/write data.

More Details
More information on this procedure and USB drives:

You can mount from the web interface, in the System → Mount Points menu.
Samba can be used to share (read/write) the drive over your network.
The full USB Drive tutorial has much more about USB drives.
For NTFS disks, refer to Writable NTFS
Look at the fstab documentation to configure from the command line
This Forum thread has a lot of background information: https://forum.openwrt.org/t/more-on-usb-drive-installation/30695/2
If you want to temporarily mount the drive (say, for testing), you can simply enter: mkdir /tmp/MyDrive; mount /dev/sda1 /tmp/MyDrive, after finishing the test reading/writing the drive: umount /tmp/MyDrive

opkg update; opkg install block-mount kmod-usb-storage kmod-fs-ext4
reboot



From a completely default state, run the following:

(install extroot dependencies)

opkg update; opkg install block-mount kmod-usb-storage kmod-fs-ext4
reboot
Plug in your USB drive and make sure it shows up:

block info
If it does...
delete everyhing on it.

mount /dev/sda1 /mnt; rm -rf /mnt; umount /mnt
(you may get an error that it can't delete /mnt but that's fine)

Now pivot to extroot:

mount /dev/sda1 /mnt ; tar -C /overlay -cvf - . | tar -C /mnt -xf - ; umount /mnt

block detect > /etc/config/fstab; \
   sed -i s/option$'\t'enabled$'\t'\'0\'/option$'\t'enabled$'\t'\'1\'/ /etc/config/fstab; \
   sed -i s#/mnt/sda1#/overlay# /etc/config/fstab; \
   cat /etc/config/fstab;
   
reboot
When it comes back up, check to see if it has mounted as overlay...

df -h
Report back with the output if there are any errors or anything unexpected.
